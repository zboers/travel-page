        <strong>Cappadocia</strong>, a semi-arid region in central Turkey, is
        known for its distinctive “fairy chimneys,” tall, cone-shaped rock
        formations clustered in Monks Valley, Göreme and elsewhere. Other
        notables sites include Bronze Age homes carved into valley walls by
        troglodytes (cave dwellers) and later used as refuges by early
        Christians. The 100m-deep Ihlara Canyon houses numerous rock-face
        churches.
